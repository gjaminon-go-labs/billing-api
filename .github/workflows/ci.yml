            Please review this Go pull request focusing on:

            ## Code Quality
            - Go best practices and idiomatic code
            - Proper error handling patterns
            - Correct use of goroutines and channels (if applicable)
            - Memory management and potential leaks

            ## Architecture
            - Domain-Driven Design principles compliance
            - Repository pattern implementation
            - Clean Architecture layer separation
            - Dependency injection patterns

            ## Testing
            - Test coverage adequacy (minimum 70% for new code)
            - Table-driven test patterns
            - Unit vs integration test separation
            - Mock usage appropriateness

            ## Go-Specific Checks
            - Proper use of interfaces
            - Error wrapping with context
            - Struct field tags correctness
            - Concurrent code safety

            ## TDD Workflow
            - Verify tests were written first (Red-Green-Refactor)
            - Check for overengineering beyond requirements
            - Ensure minimal implementation approach

            ## Security
            - SQL injection prevention
            - Input validation
            - No hardcoded secrets
            - Proper authentication/authorization

            ## Performance
            - Database query optimization
            - N+1 query problems
            - Unnecessary allocations
            - Proper use of pointers vs values

            Review the CI test results and coverage report.
            Be constructive and educational in feedback.
            Highlight both issues and good practices.
