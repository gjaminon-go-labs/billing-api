Test file for CI workflow verification
======================================

This file is created to test:
1. GitHub Actions CI pipeline execution
2. Claude Code automated review integration
3. Test and lint job execution
4. Coverage reporting to Codecov

This PR should trigger:
- test-and-lint job (runs tests, linting, coverage)
- claude-review job (automated code review)

Expected behavior:
- Both jobs should run successfully
- Claude should provide review comments
- Coverage should be reported to Codecov
- CI status checks should appear on the PR
